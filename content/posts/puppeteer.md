Greetings everyone!  

This was the first forensics challenge from  HackTheBox Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2022.  
Here, we were given multiple .evtx files which were bascially the log files created by windows Event Viewer. 
![1](/ac1.png)

Then, As I was looking for ways to view the event logs, I found that `chainsaw` is pretty amazing tool to hunt through those event logs.  

`chainsaw` detected two powershell scripts that looked malicious.  
![2](/ac2.png)  

So, I extracted those scripts by converting the output from chainsaw onto json, and using `jq`, and `sed` to do some text parsing.  
![3](/ac3.png)  

```
chainsaw hunt Logs/ --rules ./chainsaw/sigma_rules/ --mapping ./chainsaw/mapping_files/sigma-mapping.yml --json | jq ".[0]|.event" | jq ".[]|.EventData.ScriptBlockText" | sed 's/null//g' | sed 's/\\r\\n/\n/g > first.ps1'
```  
Same idea can be applied to extract another powershell script.  
```
chainsaw hunt Logs/ --rules ./chainsaw/sigma_rules/ --mapping ./chainsaw/mapping_files/sigma-mapping.yml --json | jq ".[1]|.event" | jq ".[]|.EventData.ScriptBlockText" | sed 's/null//g' | sed 's/\\r\\n/\n/g > second.ps1'
```  

Then, I checked both scripts.  
![4](/ac4.png)  

The second powershell script didn't look much interesting in regards to the ctf, but the first powershell script was very interesting.  
![5](/ac5.png)  

After some cleaning, here is what the first powershell script was:

Looks very interesting. Isn't it?  
It is just a basic XOR operation.  

Let's break down line by line what is very important for us.  
Here in lines `1 to 6`, we just import DLL.  
![6](/ac6.png)  

Then,in lines `9 to 10`, byte arrays `$stage1` and `$stage2` are being defined which are storing the hex values.  
![7](/ac7.png)  

Line `13` is not of much use to extract the flag.  

Line `16` is another byte array, which I will say `$stage4` just for simplicity.  
![8](/ac8.png)  

In line `19`, the byte array `$stage2` from line `10` is reversed.  
![9](/ac9.png)  

In line `22`, VirtualAlloc function is being called which allocates virtual memory for the code to run later on.  
![10](/ac10.png)  

In our case, it won't be of much use to us, but it is important while deploying payloads like this.  

In line `25`, the bytes of `$stage1`, and the bytes for `$stage2` that were reversed in  line `19` are concatenated together.  
![11](/ac11.png)  

In line `29`, the bytes from `$stage4` are copied onto the virtual memory location allocated above, but it is also not so important to get the flag.  
![12](/ac12.png)  

Then, In lines `34 - 37`, a simple `XOR` operation is carried out for each bytes of `$stage4` with the key `0xd1`.  
![13](/ac13.png)  

But, the above `XOR` operation doesn't result in any flag.  

There is more.  
There is another `XOR` operation in lines `41 - 43` where each bytes in `$stage3` are xored with the key `0xd1`.  
![14](/ac14.png)  

But the extracted script didn't print any flag.  
So, As the challenge iself has powershell code, I decided to write a simple powershell script to get the flag:

That gives us the flag `HTB{b3wh4r3_0f_th3_b00t5_0f_just1c3...}`  
This was a very interesting challenge as it shows how threat actors can leverage post exploitation. 

I learned something new in this challenge.  

Hope it was also helpful for you!  
Thanks for reading!  
Happy Pwning!! :) :)
