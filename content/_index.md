Hello there!  
Welcome to my Blog!  
My name is Biplav. I am a Cyber Security Engineering student, and love learning Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation. I keep participating in several Capture The Flag (CTF) events. So, I thought of sharing my writeups about those ctf challenges in this blog. Hopefully it will be useful to someone who loves solving Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation challenges in CTFs.   
Thank you!
